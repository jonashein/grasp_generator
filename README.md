# Towards Markerless Surgical Tool and Hand Pose Estimation: Synthetic Grasp Generation

This codebase is an adaptation of the original [Obman](https://hassony2.github.io/obman.html) pipeline to generate synthetic images of hand-object interactions.
While the original pipeline relies on the Eigengrasp planner that is included in the [GraspIt!](http://graspit-simulator.github.io/) simulator, this fork allows to manually generate grasp templates which are then automatically augmented and verified in the simulator.
The manual creation of grasp templates is useful for objects on which the Eigengrasp planner produces suboptimal or unnatural results, e.g. objects with designated or ergonomically formed handles. 
The generated grasps can be rendered with the [Grasp Renderer](https://github.com/jonashein/grasp_renderer).

## Setup

### Download and Install Prerequisites

This package uses a ROS [interface](https://github.com/graspit-simulator/graspit_commander) for the GraspIt! simulator.
To install and setup this interface follow the instructions at https://github.com/graspit-simulator/graspit_interface.

### Download and Install Code

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jonashein/grasp_generator.git
cd grasp_generator
python setup.py install --user --graspit_dir=$GRASPIT
```

The MANO hand model will be automatically copied to `$GRASPIT` directory during the installation. 
To copy a model without the code installation use the command:
```sh
python setup.py --copy_model_only --graspit_dir=$GRASPIT
```

## Demo
We provide exemplary [grasp templates](grasp_templates/drill_grasp_templates.txt) for the 3D drill model used in our synthetic and real datasets.
The 3D drill model can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j3V2CTVEVPzI3Ybh159dfLtRXaoTqa00/view?usp=sharing).

Follow the steps below to create new grasp templates, or use the provided grasp templates to directly generate augmented grasps.

## Generate Grasp Templates

Start the [GraspIt!](http://graspit-simulator.github.io/) simulator and load the 3D model you wish to generate grasps for:
```File -> Import Object...```.

Load the MANO hand model: Click on ```File -> Import Robot...``` and select ```./graspit/models/robots/ManoHand/ManoHand.xml```. 

To generate a grasp template, manually the hand with the object such that they resemble a natural grasp.

Use the ```Grasp -> Auto Open``` and ```Grasp -> Auto Grasp``` 
functions to automatically open and close the hand as needed. 
Also, temporarily disabling the collision system can simplify the alignment.

Capture the grasp via ```Database -> Grasp Capture... -> Capture```.
Repeat these steps until a sufficient number of grasp templates are captured.

Save the recorded grasp templates via ```Save to file...```. 
The stored file should have the same format as the [exemplary grasp templates](grasp_templates/drill_grasp_templates.txt).

## Generate Grasps

Start [ROS master](http://wiki.ros.org/roscore) in one terminal:
```sh
roscore
```

Then in a second terminal start generator, which will augment the grasp templates and verify their physical plausibility via collision detection:
```sh
python -m mano_grasp.generate_grasps --models PATH_TO_3D_OBJECT --grasps_file PATH_TO_GRASP_TEMPLATES --path_out PATH_TO_DATASET
```

Use the `-- help` flag to see all available options:
```sh
python -m mano_grasp.generate_grasps --help
```
